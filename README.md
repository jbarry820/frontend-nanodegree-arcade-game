#Arcade Game "Frogger"

This is a classic arcade game built with object-orientated Javascipt.

##How to `play` the game.

Click on the index.html file to start

The aim of the game is to get to the top row.

Character dies if it meets one of the bugs runnings across the screen. Character appears at start position (bottom of game field) and game starts again.

The game uses keyboard input, so users use keyboard arrows to move the player around the board, trying to get to the top row. When the player gets to the top row. The Game Over box appears along with a button that says "Play Again".

Enjoy the game!

What I learned

Predominantly how to write clean, object-orientated javascript, and how to manipulate objects and their methods.

Known Bugs: When the player gets to the next to the top row the Game Over sign comes up. It should not come up until the player gets to the top row.
